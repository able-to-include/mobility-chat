<h3>Welcome to AbleChat</h3>\
<p>Thanks for choosing AbleChat to communicate!</p>\
<p>To ensure AbleChat operates smoothly, some preparations are in order:</p>\
<ul>\
    <li>The coach creates an account on the website</li>\
    <li>The coach creates a profile for the client</li>\
    <li>The coach chooses pictos together with the client</li>\
    <li>The coach determines the categories that will be shown on the client's smartphone and sets up navigation between these categories.</li>\
    <li>The coach installs the app on both smartphones</li>\
</ul>\
<p>Once you have completed these preparations, you can start sending and receiving messages. \
New pictos can still be added at a later time and existing ones can still be change when necessary.</p>
